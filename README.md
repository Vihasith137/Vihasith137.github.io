## Individual Project 1 â€“ Front-end Web Development with a Professional Profile Website on github.io cloud service

**Overview**: This project involves creating a professional profile website for front-end web development using GitHub Pages. The personal portfolio has been developed and deployed on GitHub's cloud service.

To meet technical requirements, the website incorporates basic JavaScript, JQuery, and the React library. Additionally, two public web APIs are integrated to enhance functionality. JavaScript cookies are utilized for remembering users, enabling personalized greetings upon revisiting the website.

For non-technical requirements, an open-source Bootstrap framework is utilized to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design. Moreover, Google Analytics page tracker is integrated to gather insights on website traffic and visitor behavior.
